## Documentation

**What data is included?**

**1,447,270** building footprints in France (**704,172** with height information) and **54,515** building footprints in Denmark (**11,621** with height information). This data is represented in [shapefile](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Shapefiles) format.    

**What was the creation process?**

The building information was developed with sensors from low altitude aerial imagery. Due to the process in which the heights were calculated, the height value is an estimate and not an absolute measure of building height.  

**When was the data captured?**

The building footprint and height information was captured and developed in 2013.  

**What unit is the data measured in?**

The building height information is measured in meters. Please refer to [OSM height measurements](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Map_Features/Units) for additional detail.  

The shapefiles are available in two projections: [ESPG:3857 (Pseudo Mercator)](http://www.epsg-registry.org/report.htm?type=selection&entity=urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG::3857&reportDetail=short&style=urn:uuid:report-style:default-with-code&style_name=OGP%20Default%20With%20Code&title=EPSG:3857) and [EPSG:4326 (WGS 84)](http://www.epsg-registry.org/report.htm?type=selection&entity=urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG::4326&reportDetail=short&style=urn:uuid:report-style:default-with-code&style_name=OGP%20Default%20With%20Code&title=EPSG:4326).
