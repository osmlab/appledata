# Apple Data Projects

Information about:

* Data Improvement [Projects](https://github.com/osmlab/appledata/issues) being worked on by the Apple [Data Team](https://github.com/osmlab/appledata/wiki/Data-Team). Our team uses the hashtag #adt (for Apple Data Team) for our edits.   

* [MapRoulette](https://github.com/osmlab/appledata/wiki/MapRoulette-Challenges) challenges we posted around the world that anyone can participate in, mostly to roads and water. They were created with Atlas (listed below).

* A [JOSM Paint Style](https://github.com/osmlab/applepaintstyles) we created for easier editing, visualization and data validation.

* [Atlas](https://github.com/osmlab/atlas), a tool Apple created for querying, visualizing, and storing OpenStreetMap data.

* Building Footprint [Data](https://github.com/osmlab/appledata/blob/master/BUILDINGS.md) that Apple is sharing.
